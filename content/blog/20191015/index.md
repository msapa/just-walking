The view we saw in the morning was stunning.

Our target today was a Barafu aka Base camp.


Hiking from Karanga to Barafu was very quick. The rest of the day we spend on doing nothing and resting before the summit attack.

Our last camp and our last whole night in a tent. Due to altitude, we didn't eat much.
This was the biggest camp we were sleeping in, also, there was a helicopter landing nearby and we did hear them.
