This time Moravian-Silesian Beskids. I was at the highest peak there, Smrk is the 2nd one. Smrk is a very easy peak to reach. The most difficult was the amount of snow that was there.

Funny thing, there is John Lennon memorial stone there.

We did start from the forest parking place, we were there early in Saturday, so we didn't have problems with leaving our car, however, there is plenty of parking places in Ostravica (Czech people very like Lysa Hora, and path on this mountain also start in Ostrawica).

We have very nice weather, that's why there are so many photos.
