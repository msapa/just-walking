[That is a path I use to reach cave](mapa-turystyczna.pl/route/awbz)

To get to the Komoniecki's cave mapaturystyczna will be helpful. It will show forest paths.
I did leave my car at the shop's parking (in Polish they are closed on Sunday). However, there is a church very near so you can also leave a car there.

The main goal is to find Soliska street and follow it, there are however many places where you can miss the correct path, so I recommend using mapaturystyczna in places where you are not sure.

The cave is very nice, however, it is not deep or big. Additionally nearby there is a largest (big word) waterfall in Little Beskids [Dusiołek](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusio%C5%82ek_(wodospad))

There is a path that leads from the cave to [Rozstaje pod Łamaną Skałą](https://mapa-turystyczna.pl/node/rozstaje-pod-lamana-skala). Some of the trees have a symbol on them [(something like this)](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/2748982/appearance_form_formation_geomatric_half_circle_shapes_icon). So it is easier to follow, however, these sighs are very rare.

Additionally, on this trip, we did visit student hut [Chatka na Potrójnej](http://www.potrojna.com.pl/). Worth visiting place.

Additionally very near by is [Zbójeckie Okno](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zb%C3%B3jeckie_Okno) that name you can translate to 'a rogue window'. It is a very nice rock formation.

We used the normal path (PTTK one) to get back to the car.
