This time I'm starting from Porąbka, I leave a car on huge parking near the city hall.
There was a problem with finding a path in the first place, but it goes on the right of a church, mapaturystyczna helps a lot.

This trip was right before the end of the year, with no people, a huge amount of snow and silence.

Kiczera is very near a popular mountain Żar, so there were a few people on top of them (because this is easy to reach Żar with a car).

In the middle of a trip is a place where you can eat. It is a huge hotel with a restaurant. They have nice food, so my belly was full for the rest of the day.
