This is the first logged trip after Kilimanjaro, however, there was a trip on a Skrzyczne meanwhile, but I don't have a proper photo.

This was a very windy day, however. We start in a forest parking place, there is a decent about of space there, so it shouldn't be a problem. However, I think that the blue path is one of the hardest ways to reach Chrobacza Łąka.
