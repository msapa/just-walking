Wow, this is the first post I ever create on this blog,
there will be some info about why am I doing this and so on. However, let's start.

There was a lovely trip to Jałowiec, It was my first time there and I can tell that it is a very nice mountain.

I did leave my car near the church, here is huge parking, should not be a problem with leaving there a car. There should be a possibility of getting there by train because Hucisko has a PKP station.

The path was very peaceful, I met about 20 other people on a path, probably because of the amount of snow that was on a track.
